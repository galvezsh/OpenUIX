# OpenUIX ✨

**OpenUIX** is a small, open-source graphical user interface template built in **Java 8** using **Swing** and **Forms**.  
Originally created as a basic project, it’s still under active development and aims to provide a simple, dynamic, and reusable UI foundation for other small Java applications.

## ✨ Features
- 🎨 **Theme Switching** – Easily switch between Java Look & Feels such as **Nimbus**, **Metal**, **Windows**, **Windows Classic**, and more via a configuration file.
- 🌍 **Multi-language Support** – Built-in localization system for different languages.
- 🖥 **Event Logging Console** – A lightweight console that collects and displays application activity logs, such as:
    - 📂 Configuration file detection and creation.
    - ⚠️ Error tracking and status updates.
- ⚡ **Plug & Play** – Designed to be simple to integrate into any small Java project.

## 🛠 How It Works
When first run, OpenUIX automatically generates a configuration file that stores the selected theme and language.  
Users can edit this file to quickly change the UI appearance and language without modifying the source code.

## 🚀 Roadmap
- 🎨 Additional theme presets.
- 🌐 Expanded multi-language library.
- 📊 Improved event console with filtering and export options.
- 🧩 More modular UI components.
